###:cherry_blossom: Before You Install :cherry_blossom:

Before you install my **Utility Tool**, you will need an app that you developed with **NodeJS**.

###:cherry_blossom: Install :cherry_blossom:

To install my **Utility Tool**, in your CLI, change your current directory to your app's directory, and type `npm install am_utility_tool --save`. This will add **am_utility_tool** to your *package.json* file's list of dependencies and install it to your *node_modules* directory.
