###:cherry_blossom: Before You Install :cherry_blossom:

Before you install my **Utility Tool**, you will need an app that you developed with **NodeJS**.

###:cherry_blossom: Install :cherry_blossom:

To install my **Utility Tool**, in your CLI, change your current directory to your app's directory, and type `npm install am_utility_tool --save`. This will add **am_utility_tool** to your *package.json* file's list of dependencies and install it to your *node_modules* directory.

###:cherry_blossom: Debugging :cherry_blossom:

My **Utility Tool** lets you debug your app and display either a success or an error message in your CLI, and also save all success and error messages in a .log file in your logs directory, which you will need to create.

To use my **Utility Tool**, you will need to require **am_utility_tool** in the file you want to debug. You can do this by typing `const debug = require('am_utility_tool')` at the top of the file. Then you will need to call either the debugSuccess or debugError functions with an argument of either a success or an error message wherever you want to use them. For example, if you want to call the debugError function in one of your routes, your code may look like this:

```
res.status(500).json(err);
debug.debugError('The user was not successfully redirected to the long URL because of the following error: ' + err);
```

To turn debugging on, in your CLI, change your current directory to your app's directory if it's not already your current directory, and type `DEBUG=true` before you start your server.

Now if your route errors out, you will get an error message in your CLI that says, *The user was not successfully redirected to the long URL because of the following error: [error]*. You will also get a .log file in your logs directory that says the same thing.
